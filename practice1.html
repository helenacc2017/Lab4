    Something of Halloween from Wikipedia. Halloween or Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween,[5] All Hallows'
    Eve,[6] or All Saints' Eve)[7] is a
    celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It
    begins the observance of Allhallowtide,[8] the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead,
    including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the departed.[9][10]<br>
